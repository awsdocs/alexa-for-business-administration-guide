# Manage contacts<a name="manage-contacts"></a>

To call people using Alexa, add contacts to Alexa for Business\. After you create contacts, you can add them to address books\. Edit or delete a contact at any time\.

Contacts can contain multiple phone numbers and one SIP address\. When asking Alexa to call someone, you can add the words "at home," "work," or "mobile\." Say something like: "Alexa, call John Stileâ€™s mobile\." If a contact has both a work phone number and SIP address, Alexa always calls the work phone number\.

To bulk import contacts into Alexa for Business, use the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK\. For more information, see [Alexa for Business API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)\.
