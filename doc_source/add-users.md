# Invite users to join your organization<a name="add-users"></a>

To enable users to access Alexa for Business features on their personal Alexa devices, invite them to join your organization\. They receive a token that enables them to join your organization\.

A user might fail to enroll while the token is valid\. In this case, you can resend the invitation\.

If you remove a user, they no longer have the benefits of being in your organization\. If you remove a user who has not completed enrollment, the token they received is no longer valid\.

**Prerequisites**
+ Before you can invite users, you must first set up user invitations\. For more information, see [Set up user invitations](enroll-users.md)\.
+ Gather the name and email address for each user\. Typically, the email address can be mapped to an identity for your organization\. When connecting to a Microsoft Exchange account, this must be the email address used by the Exchange server\.
