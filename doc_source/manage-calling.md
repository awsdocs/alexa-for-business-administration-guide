# Manage calling from shared devices using Alexa for Business<a name="manage-calling"></a>

You can make calls from your shared devices with Alexa for Business\. You can call a contact that you defined in the Alexa for Business console by saying the name out loud\. Likewise, you can call a contact's number by saying the number out loud\. For example, say "Alexa, call helpdesk" or "Alexa, call 206\-555\-0126\."

+ Emergency services numbers \(for example, "911"\)

+ N\-1\-1 numbers or abbreviated dial codes \(for example, "211" or "411"\)

+ Dial\-by\-letter numbers \(for example, "1\-800\-FLOWERS"\)
